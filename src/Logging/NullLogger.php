 * This Logger can be used to avoid conditional log calls.

 * library creating a NullLogger instance to have something to throw logs at
 * is a good way to avoid littering your code with `if ($this->logger) { }`
 * blocks.
 *
 * This logger extends the PSR Compliant NullLogger to implement __set_state()
 * This allows default support for var_export() compatable code generation.
 * Any logger you implement will need to return a PSR compliant logger instance
 * In the __set_state() function for var_export() to work as expected.
